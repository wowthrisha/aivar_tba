# Defect Register

| ID | Symptom | Root cause | Fix | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D-01 | `tests/test_llm.py::test_out_of_range_value_is_rejected` failed with `UnboundLocalError` | Python deletes an `except ... as name` binding when the except block exits, so `real_validation_error` was referenced after being auto-deleted | Captured the exception into a variable declared before the try/except instead | Fixed |

## LEFT OUT

Scope explicitly cut or deferred, and why. Per contract E-6/E-7 — report
what was not done, never substitute silently.

- No application logic in T-04 (scaffold only, per task spec).
- `requirements.txt` dependency versions left unpinned — pinning exact
  versions now would be guessing; to be finalized when feature code lands
  and real compatibility constraints are known.
- T-08: `router.route_action`'s explanation, when a floor fires, states the
  floor's own reason (e.g. "irreversible action affecting 500 records (>=
  100)") but does not compute a floor-specific counterfactual ("would have
  been CONFIRM if affected_records < 100"). Production approach: extend
  each floor's reason with its own avoidance condition once a concrete
  need for it appears (e.g. in T-18's README worked example) — not needed
  to satisfy T-08's literal assertions (composite + tier + triggering
  reason present in the string).
