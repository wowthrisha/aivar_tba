# Defect Register

| ID | Symptom | Root cause | Fix | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D-01 | `tests/test_llm.py::test_out_of_range_value_is_rejected` failed with `UnboundLocalError` | Python deletes an `except ... as name` binding when the except block exits, so `real_validation_error` was referenced after being auto-deleted | Captured the exception into a variable declared before the try/except instead | Fixed |
| D-02 | Every real `/v1/actions/evaluate` call showed `llm_degraded: true` in the audit log during T-10's live curl verification; confidence always fell back to 0.0, spuriously tripping the T-07 `low_confidence` floor on low-risk actions | `app/llm.py`'s `.parse()` call passed `temperature=0` per T-09's literal spec. The live pinned model (`gpt-5.6-luna`) rejects that value: `Error code: 400 - "Unsupported value: 'temperature' does not support 0 with this model. Only the default (1) value is supported."` T-09's mocked tests never caught this since they mock the client and never exercise the real `temperature` argument. Present since T-09's original commit — not introduced by T-10. | Removed the `temperature=0` argument (approved by product owner) so the SDK uses the model's required default. Root cause and fix confirmed via a real live call: `confidence: 0.82, degraded: False, reason: None`. | Fixed |

## LEFT OUT

Scope explicitly cut or deferred, and why. Per contract E-6/E-7 — report
what was not done, never substitute silently.

- No application logic in T-04 (scaffold only, per task spec).
- `requirements.txt` dependency versions left unpinned — pinning exact
  versions now would be guessing; to be finalized when feature code lands
  and real compatibility constraints are known.
- T-08: `router.route_action`'s explanation, when a floor fires, states the
  floor's own reason (e.g. "irreversible action affecting 500 records (>=
  100)") but does not compute a floor-specific counterfactual ("would have
  been CONFIRM if affected_records < 100"). Production approach: extend
  each floor's reason with its own avoidance condition once a concrete
  need for it appears (e.g. in T-18's README worked example) — not needed
  to satisfy T-08's literal assertions (composite + tier + triggering
  reason present in the string).
- T-10: idempotency_key is accepted and stored on evaluate/execute
  requests but not yet enforced (no replay-returns-original-result
  behavior). S-2's dedicated enforcement + test is T-12's job.
- T-10: approval expiry (S-3) is enforced lazily — checked at execute
  time, not by a background sweep — since no scheduler exists. An
  approval past its expires_at is only actually marked EXPIRED when
  something reads/executes it. Acceptable for this system's shape (no
  external party needs to observe "expired" before then), but worth
  naming: `GET /v1/actions/{id}` does NOT currently trigger the same
  lazy-expiry check that `execute` does, so a stale GET can show a
  not-yet-expired APPROVED state past its TTL until execute is attempted.
  Production approach: apply `_check_expiry` in the GET handler too, or
  add a scheduled sweep — deferred since T-10's own DoD doesn't require
  it and no endpoint's correctness depends on GET reflecting expiry
  eagerly.
- T-10: `/v1/audit` filtering/pagination is basic (action_id, event_type,
  limit/offset) — no cursor-based pagination or filtering by date range.
  Sufficient for T-10's DoD ("filterable, paginated"); can be extended if
  a later task needs more.
- T-11: the 9 T-10 business endpoints (evaluate, confirm, decision,
  execute, audit list/verify, review-queue) still read/write
  `InMemoryStore`/`AuditLog`, not the new Postgres tables. T-11's DoD
  ("alembic current on DIRECT; app on POOLED; \dt shows 4 tables") is
  infrastructure proof and does not literally require the swap; a full
  store rewrite would mean re-touching and re-verifying all 9 already-
  proven T-10 endpoints, which is a materially larger task than the 1h
  box. Only `/readyz`'s db check uses the real POOLED engine. Production
  approach: implement a `SQLAlchemyStore` behind the same interface as
  `InMemoryStore` (the interface was already kept swap-ready for this)
  and switch `app/main.py`'s `_store`/`_audit` module globals over to it
  — flagged for explicit confirmation before doing it, since it's a
  meaningfully larger change than T-11's literal DoD asks for.
